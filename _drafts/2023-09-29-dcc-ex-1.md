While I am waiting for the track and locomotive to arrive for my Scenic Ridge layout, I figured I would move on to building a DCC-EX control station.  Sure, I could have gone out and purchased a [Digitrax Zephyr Express](https://www.digitrax.com/products/starter-sets/dcs52/) or an [NCE Power Cab](https://www.ncedcc.com/online-store/Power-Cab-Starter-Set-with-24-watt-110-240V-US-Power-Supply-p38322079) starter set, but where's the fun in that?  If you don't like working with electronics, I suggest you start with one of those two systems.  I lean towards the Digitrax system, but both have good tutorials and videos online.

So, what did I buy again?

There are two steps to this - assembling the command station (the hardware) and programming the command station (the software).

## Assembling the Command Station

To put this together, you'll also need a static free area that is close to your PC.  You can also do this on a Mac or Linux box (and I have both), but I am doing this on a PC because that is where I write my blogs.  In terms of tools, you'll not need a lot - a small flat head screw-driver, a set of wire-strippers, and a pair of scissors to open the various bags.  You may also need a small set of pliers to straighten out any bent pins.  My motor shield arrived with a couple of bent pins that needed to be straightened:

![The two boards](/assets/img/2023-09-28-img1.jpg)

Let's start with putting together the hardware. If you prefer to watch a video, I recommend [DriverDTrains video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HatlU7A5S5s), or the [official DCC-EX video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6TWR7fIl0A&t=5s).  I find DriverDTrains more approachable.  If you prefer the official video, note that the Arduino Mega board I purchased has Wifi on the board, so I don't need a separate Wifi board or the jumper cables to the serial connection.

First off, straighten any bent pins. It's hard enough to put the pins in the right place without the problems caused by bent pins.  Then, take a look at the side with the pins.  There is a small "jumper" near the pins labelled VIN.  This needs to be cut.  Mine was already cut, but double-check yours. Doing this prevents the power supply plugged into the motor shield from frying the Arduino board underneath.

One side of the motor board has a couple more pins than the other - start by lining up the pins on that side and then the other side.  Don't push the board down yet - it should look like this:

![Inserting the motor board into the Arduino Mega](/assets/img/2023-09-28-img2.jpg)

Double-check that all the pins are inserted into the whole.  Note that the green power block on the motor shield lines up over the power connector for the main board.  Once you are sure you have everything lined up and all the pins in their right holes, you can push down to join the motor shield to the main Arduino board.

Before we connect it to our PC, let's make some power cables.  There are three cables needed,, each one comprising of two wires.  We'll use the red cable for the positive and the black cable for the negative.  Why three?  Well, one is inbound power - we'll plug out power supply into that one.  Then we have one for the main track and one for the programming track.  You can create a nice box for the finished system and expose those sockets on the back of the box if you like.  I've purchased some paired connectors for this purpose.  I'll probably put it in a box at some point, however.

Here are all the parts we're going to need:

![The parts for the Arduino DCC-EX system](/assets/img/2023-09-28-img3.jpg)

Take a look at the green block on top.  There are three pairs (or six) of connectors that you need to wire.  The pair closest to the edge is the incoming power.  The next set go to the main track and the final set go to the programming track.  In addition, the negative (or black wire) should go in the connection closest to the edge, then red, and then continue alternating colors.  First off, wire the power supply connector.  I made this the shortest of the set of three.  You don't need the plug piece for this (since the plug piece is provided by the power supply you will be plugging in).  Take a look at the socket.  Right above where you insert the wires, you will see a diagram showing the positive on the left and the negative on the right.  It's really faint.

![The power cable is attached](/assets/img/2023-09-28-img4.jpg)

I found that the 2.4mm jewelers flat-head screwdriver did the job for screwing down the cables.  Now, all you have to do is repeat the same thing for the other two pairs.  Here is what it looks like when complete:

![The completed Arduino unit](/assets/img/2023-09-28-img5.jpg)

The final step - use the provided cable to connect the USB to your PC.  Mine came with a mini-USB cable, but the board actually had a micro-USB socket.  Fortunately, I have plenty of USB cables around.

Once it is plugged into your computer, make sure you can see a green light on the board.  This will tell you it's powered and ready.

## Programming the Command Station

There are two steps to this, unless you feel like tinkering with the source code:

1. Download the EX-Installer.
2. Run the EX-Installer.

If you prefer the full Arduino experience, jump on the [DCC-EX](https://dcc-ex.com) website and follow their instructions.

You can [download the EX-Installer from their website](https://dcc-ex.com/download/ex-commandstation.html#ex-installer&gsc.tab=0).  My PC (like most PCs these days) is Windows x64, and if you are running Windows, it's a safe bet that this is your version as well.  Note that Windows thinks EX-Installer is not trustworthy, but that's because there haven't been enough reports for it.  Then, just open the file that was downloaded.  Here is the first screen - not much happening here.

![The EX-Installer - step 1](/assets/img/ex-installer/step-1.png)

Just click on "Manage Arduino CLI" to continue.

![Manage the Arduino CLI](/assets/img/ex-installer/step-2.png)

Here, click on "Install Arduino CLI".  It's a one-time thing that allows the application to communicate with the Arduino board.  It will do some work, including requesting that you allow access to the network (the application is communicating with the internet to download the Arduino CLI).

Finally, you can click on "Select your device".

![Select your device](/assets/img/ex-installer/step-3.png)

It's likely you have more than one serial device. Unfortunately, they don't give you a lot to go on, so I selected USB-SERIAL first.  If that doesn't work, you can always restart and select another one. 

Look in the drop down next to it and select the type of board you have (Arduino Mega or Mega 2560).  Then press "Select product to install".

![Select the product](/assets/img/ex-installer/step-4.png)

We want the EX-CommandStation, so click on that to proceed.

![Select EX-CommandStation version](/assets/img/ex-installer/step-5.png)

Unless you know differently, you want the latest production version and to configure options on the next screen.  You can save your configuration (later on) which will save you a step the next time.  Once ready, click "Configure EX-CommandStation".

![Configure options](/assets/img/ex-installer/step-6.png)

What a lot of options!  Since I have embedded wifi, I turned Wifi on.  I also selected the standard motor shield, since that's what I have.  Selecting the drop-down allows you to see all the boards they support though.  Some investigation is in order here for what the differences between the motor shields are, in case I want an alternative.

Also, click on "Wifi Options" to see what your options are there!

![Configure Wifi options](/assets/img/ex-installer/step-7.png)

I'm going to set mine up to connect to my existing Wifi access point which is in the same room.  It's easier to set up EX-CommandStation as an access point, but your phone, tablet, or whatever throttle you are using is then not able to access the Internet.

Once done, click on "Compile and load".  Ensure your Arduino is still plugged in, and then click on "Load".  It will take a couple of minutes, so let it run and don't touch anything.

If there is an error, there could be a couple of reasons.  Two of the biggest are that the cable connecting your Arduino to the PC is not 
complete.  The first cable I tried didn't work, so I went hunting for an alternative and that worked.  The second reason is that you chose the wrong serial port.  Just restart from the beginning and select a different port.

If neither of them works, it's time to break out Arduino IDE and do some troubleshooting.  If that's not your speed, perhaps select a DCC Starter Set that is already built instead.
