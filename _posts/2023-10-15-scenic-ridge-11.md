Just to catch everyone up, I'm working on tunnel construction.  Parts of this include laying down the track bed and then gluing down the track. Today, I'm going to be laying ballast on the initial part of the tunnel - from just outside the tunnel entrance to about 3"-6" inside the tunnel.  The more curved the track, the shorter the distance has to be.  I'm going to start on the long straight part so I can get used to ballasting before I move to tackle the curved sections.

Here are the tools for today:

I've transferred a small amount (about 3 oz.) of the scenic cement into a dropper bottle.  I also have an eye dropper if needed.  These are all readily available on Amazon.  I've transferred the bag of fine ballast to a tub for easier access.  The tub has a screw top lid, and I got it at my local supermarket.  Finally, I've got a collection of brushes that I got from my local Target.

The process of ballasting seems to be straight forward.  Just lay some ballast over the desired area with a small spoon.

Then, using a small stiff brush, gently coax it into the place you want it to be.

I started to use a random brush, but after a couple of sweeps, I realized I needed a very stiff brush.  The idea is to get the ballast below the level of the sleepers.  I ended up heaping the ballast in the middle, then running my finger through the middle of the tracks to distribute the ballast to the sides.  Finally, I used a small stiff brush to coax the ballast where I wanted it to be.  Repeat as many times as necessary (which was about five minutes per section).

Finally, use the scenic cement to glue it down.

This is the first run through, and I used way too much scenic cement. I need to cut back significantly, but it does look like wet sand. Once the glue dries, it will hold firm.

Three more sections to do, and then I believe I am onto actually building tunnels.  Don't forget to hit the rails with your handy rail cleaner (I use a Walthers Bright Boy) before running your train.

Until next time, happy modeling!
