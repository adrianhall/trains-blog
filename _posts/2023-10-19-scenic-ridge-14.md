You may remember that [yesterday, I put the profile boards together]({% post_url 2023-10-18-scenic-ridge-13 %}).  Today, the glue is dry, so it's time to start forming the outline of the scenery in the profile boards.  This involves cutting out the templates that Woodland Scenics provides (including the bits for the access panels), then pinning them to the boards and carefully cutting away the excess.  I used scissors for this, rather than a knife.  It's mostly free form anyhow.

I liked the carving attachment for the foam cutter for this bit instead of the bow. There is a long carving attachment and a short one.  I started with the long one, but it proved too flexible, so I switched to the short one when I started carving the front profile boards. It provided a lot more fluid curves when I was carving the profile boards up.  It also allowed me to cut out the access panels without resorting to a knife, which resulted in better looking cuts.  Here is the left hand side finished.

The positioning of the template took more time than the actual cutting.  This is especially true because you don't need to be too careful with the cutting.  The idea is to have a mountain when I'm finished, so I want it all ragged.

The same cannot be said for the access panel.  Firstly, I need the access panel to put back as a panel.  Secondly, it's rectangular.  So I used a straight edge.

The long sides (front and back) use two templates.  The instructions tell you to stick them together to form one long template and then cut around that.  I just did them as two halves.  I find I can't cut that neatly for that long, so it's better to do it in three or four bits rather than one.  The scraps from the front are so small that they are not going to get reused.

I finished up with the back side, since that has two access panels needing cutting.  The instructions suggest using some of the profile board as mounts so that the access panels can be removed but stay put when there.  I'm thinking duct tape as a hinge will also work.  I'm going to work on something "innovative" here.

Experience so far - I like the risers that Woodland Scenics produces, but the profile boards and foam cut-outs seem to be more hassle than they are worth.  It's an expensive way to do landscape that can be better done with pink foam board and some carving tools.  The mechanics that they suggest in the instructions also guarantees that you will waste a lot of material.  I don't think I'll be doing this method of scenery constructions on my next layout.

Once the work was complete, this is what it looked like:

You can't quite see the access panels but I left them laying down in the holes to remind me that I need to do something with them.  Eventually, the outside will be covered in plaster cloth, so it will be quite sturdy and all the blemishes will be covered up.

The next step is to cover the tunnel, but that's another day. I think I've done enough for today and I need to get away from the burning foam smell for a while.  Until next time, happy modeling!
