Welcome to my trains blog.

As a way of introduction, I'm Adrian Hall - a guy in my 50's who works in tech.  I've lived in the US for 30 years (and currently living outside of Seattle); before that I grew up in England, and I loved model trains back then.  Now I've got to the point of my life of having time on my hands, I thought it would be a good idea to get back into it.

To kick off my new old hobby, I thought I would build something that already had a lot of planning in it, but adjust it along the way to be mine.  As a result, I've picked up [Scenic Ridge](https://www.hobbytown.com/woodland-scenics-scenic-ridge-layout-kit-n-scale-woost1482/p291522) by Woodland Scenics, together with the [Atlas Track Pack](https://www.trainz.com/products/atlas-2588-n-scale-scenic-ridge-track-pack) to go along with it.  I'm not sure where it is going to end up, but I'm sure I'll have fun building it.

> **Links and prices**
>
> I want my blog to be instructive as well as just a bunch of ideas, so future blogs will contain the details on where I purchased things from (or the manufacturers page if not available), and the prices I paid at the time of writing, but I remove the tracking information.  Please don't bug me about links not working or prices being different.  Do your own research!

Since this is a new blog and a new layout, I figured I'd put some of my ideas down.

1. I want to learn scenery. I didn't do a lot of scenery when I was running trains in my teenage years, and that seems fun.  This is why I purchased Scenic Ridge - it looks like an introduction to scenery.
2. I want to run DCC.  Explicitly, I want to run [DCC-EX](https://dcc-ex.com), because I'm into tech and Arduino has always fascinated me.
3. I don't want to use the stock building kit that you can buy from Woodland Scenics.  The layout doesn't lend itself to a busy town - it's more of an old-timey quarry and village type thing.  I also want to try different model types - cardstock, laser cut, plastic, and so on.  So I'll be buying individual models.
4. I have a sense of humor, so I want to include the whimsical.  Maybe a sasquatch, or an alien or two.  Who knows what I'll find when I am searching Etsy!

Along the way, I'm going to provide details of the stuff I buy for the hobby; what I had laying around; and what I found useful (videos, blogs, etc.)  Feel free to put stuff in the comments (which is backed by GitHub Discussions for this site).  I'm always happy to hear suggestions, advice, and whatever else you want to say.

Thanks for joining me on my journey!

## Parts List

In the table below are the parts for this layout that I purchased. I do not include tools in the parts list, as quite a few came from my garage, and can be reused between layouts.  This should be representative of how much this layout would cost to build.

I do not include tax or shipping in the amounts.  These vary wildly between localities.  I shop in US dollars, so those prices are also in US dollars.

As you can see, you are not saving *that* much going with DCC-EX, and end up with a much less polished product that is more technically challenging to implement.
