I know I said I was going to be laying turf next, but first, let me talk a little about the [Snoring Warrior Tavern](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4776313).  This is a free building that is hosted on Thingiverse and designed for [Gracewindle](https://www.patreon.com/gracewindale).  It's a really nice model.  I had to print it at 44% size on my [Elegoo Saturn 3 Ultra](https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-saturn-3-resin-3d-printer-12k).

After downloading the files, I used [Microsoft 3D Builder](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9WZDNCRFJ3T6) to combine the three pieces into a single model.  You can see a video on how to do this [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkKdQr9BCik).  In fact, I followed along with this video to get it combined.  Once I had the model the way I wanted it, I saved it as an STL file.

When I am using my 3D printer, I need to use a slicer.  In my case, this was [Chitubox](https://www.chitubox.com) free edition.  This has built-in support for my printer and I've printed plenty of things with it.  I had to tilt the building by 30 degrees (since resin printers don't like things to be flat on the plate), scale the model (44% seems to work for a lot of these models to make them N scale), and add supports.  I used [Sunlu Standard Resin](https://www.sunlu.com/collections/standard-resin) to print it.

Once that was done, I used Army Painter matte black primer all over it.  So far so good.  Here is where it gets a little wierd.  I paint miniatures as well, so I decided I was going to do grey highlights first.  I started off with Citadel Colors Eshin Grey using a dry brush.  A dry brush is just like a makeup brush.  In fact, I purchased mine as an eco-friendly makeup brush from the local drug store.  There are lots of tutorials on dry brushing on YouTube (I like [this one]()), so just watch one and go to town.  I started with a rather heavy application of Citadel Colors Eshin Grey, letting it dry afterwards for 15 minutes.  Yes, that's probably more time than it needs.  Correcting painting issues is long-winded though, so better to be slower and more deliberate.

Once the Eshin Grey was dry, I followed up with a lighter dry brush layer of Orc Grey (by The Army Painter).  This gets you this effect:

After Orc Grey, I added Administratum Grey and Ulthuan Grey (both from Citadel Colors) - getting lighter and lighter each time.  Finally, I added a dry brush layer of Citaldel Colors White Scar, using this to just lightly brush the edges to give a highlight.  (If you want to see how this is done on miniatures, head to YouTube and look up some [Slap Chop videos](https://www.youtube.com/@heresyismytherapy/videos)).

The nice thing about this effect is that the stone work looks like real stones.  I only really need to paint the wood and roof sections.  I'm going to also paint the lower chimney section, but that could also be left with just the dry brush.  The paints I am going to use for this:

* The wood is Brown Bear (yes, that's a color)
* The doors are a mix of Elven Green and Chaotic Black - don't use too much black.  I'm just using this to "tone down" the bright green.  If possible, just pick a color close to what you want.
* The tile roof is a combination of Neutral Red and Chaotic Black.  the same goes for this.  I'm going to a "roof tile" type color - which definitely isn't blood red.  Experiment with colors, or pick one that works for you.
* The mottle sections in the roof are a mix of Ancient Bones and Spaceship Exterior (and yes, those are also both colors!)

All colors came from a starter set by The Army Painter.  To apply these, I put a few drops of the paint on my Wet Palette and mixed in a little bit of water to thin it down.  I'm using a ratio of 4 drop of paint to 1 drop of water.  I then use this mix to apply a thin layer of paint to the model; let it dry for 15 minutes, then apply a second layer of paint.  Let that second layer dry.  If you are happy with the color saturation after it dries, move onto the next color.  Otherwise, repeat until you are happy.

Once I had gone around all the colors, I took a look at clean-up of the stone work and covered that with stippled grey.

Take some instruction from miniature painters - two thin coats is better than a thick coat.

Here is the resulting model:

The paint job is not perfect, but the model is small so the problems with it are only obvious when you blow the photograph up.  I often view my model via the viewfinder in the iPad camera app and am discouraged by the problems I see.  I have to remind myself that the iPad shows all the imperfections and you don't see them from even a foot away.

In case you are wondering how much it costs to print these, each model costs around $1.75 in resin costs (according to Chitubox) and takes approximately 3.5 hours to print.  There are also consumables (like disposable gloves, Isopropyl Alcohol, kitchen towels) that would make it closer to a $5 investment and 4 hours per building.  It's still way less than buying the buildings, but you have more work to do.

Until next time, happy modeling!
