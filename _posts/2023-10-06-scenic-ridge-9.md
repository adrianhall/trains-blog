I'm excited today, mostly because the layout will have something other than white stuff on it today.  I'm going to be laying the track bed.  First off, I re-installed the track (you've seen it before, so I don't need to show it again).  Then I traced around the track within the tunnels (the bits on the plaster cloth) with a pencil.  This will be my guide as to where to install the track bed.  I also marked the end of the little bit of the track that won't be glued down yet.  If necessary, I'll continue the plaster cloth and the track bed to that point.

Then I got to work with the track bed.  I opted to do the first piece alone.  To do this, I first test-laid it, and marked the end so that I knew where the glue should go to.

Once you know how much glue to lay down, you basically spread the glue in a thin schmear on both the plaster cloth and the underside of the track bed, then wait for it to go clear.  Once it's tacky and clear, you can push it into place, then secure it with foam nails.

I used a section of the shiny card box that the track pack came in for spreading the glue. It can take up to an hour to get to the tacky phase, but you don't want to leave it along lest it dries completely.  The advice is to tack foam nails every 6 inches for straights and every 2 inches for curves.  Here is the track bed laid down and tacked.

I did get a little glue on the top surface, but I made sure to wipe away with a slightly damp cloth before continuing.  Even though I'm eventually going to be gluing the track down, I don't want any unnecessary bumps in the top track bed at this point.

After that, it was on to the next one and then the next one. Completely laying each one in turn felt easier to me - less prone to mistakes.  So I went slow.  The tight curves were the hardest to get right.  So much for 2 inches - I was going a foam nail every inch.  I was glad that the tacky glue was there to help when I was laying them down.   For the curves, I laid the track bed down and tacked at the same time.

The top level took three pieces of track bed.  The bottom level took two and a third pieces of track bed.  I had to cut a couple of small pieces.  Save the scraps - you don't know where you are going to need to fill in later, when you do the rest of the layout.

> I like foam tack glue.  Letting it try until you get it tacky allows you to position, yet still get a strong bond when it dries.  However, I think it's just the Woodland Scenics tradename for standard tacky glue, which a number of companies produce.  It even comes in a spray can for those hard to get places and even distribution.  If you don't like the cost of Woodland Scenics, try one of the other suppliers.

Before I get to laying track permanently, I need to think if I want to solder the track inside the tunnels and how I'm going to get power to the track.  Hiding the track feeders inside the tunnel is obviously a good idea, and I won't be able to solder the track inside the tunnels later.  I'm leaning towards getting the soldering kit out and doing the work before gluing down the track in the tunnel.

But that's the next post.
