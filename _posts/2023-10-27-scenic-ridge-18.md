Hello, once again!  In my last post, I [started on landscape building]({% post_url 2023-10-24-scenic-ridge-17 %}).  Once I got the hang of it, I realized that the mountain was going to be a problem.  It's "big" and I don't have that much newspaper.  So I decided to use the offcuts from the XPS foam I cut for the building platforms as filler.  Here is how I started:

As you can see, I've cut down the offcuts to produce a laying effect - each layer is slightly smaller than the lower one.  But I've done it in a relatively haphazard way so it doesn't just look like a bunch of terraces.  I didn't glue them down.  They are just filler.  Once that was done, I had a few places where it would become flat, so I put smaller pieces there.

Next, I put long strips of plaster cloth over the top.  Using my spray bottle, I anchored the top and bottom and smoothed out the plaster.  The water makes the plaster in the cloth an adhesive, and I used that as the anchors.

I had to cut top and bottom at the corner to ensure it laid properly, but overall I think it looks reasonable.  Not good; just reasonable.  I don't think this is a good way to do landscape, but the newspaper and plaster cloth is worse, especially when you don't have enough newspaper.  I would much rather have piled up enough XPS foam then carved it down to make the hill and the tunnel at the same time.  

This is what it looks like once I placed all the strips across:

As you can see, it's not really covering because of the holes in the cloth.  However, everything is sprayed down and smoothed out, so hopefully it will make a shell that I can layer upon.  Then I'll go over the mountain once more with another layer that I will smooth out, producing the nice landscape effect I'm after.  I also didn't worry about how it all joins up with the platforms.  Again, I'll go back over that.

As you can see, the ridges of the cut foam is still showing through.  I'll live with this since this is a "learning" layout.  Next time, I'm going to forego the newspaper and plaster cloth.  Instead I'm going to carve XPS Foam and then slather it in tinted Mod Podge - a tried and trusted mechanism that I suspect is also faster and cleaner.  Plaster cloth makes a lot of mess.

Next up. I'll concentrate on the lower mountain and blending it into the platforms.  Here, I will use newspaper underneath as it is much more malleable to create the right look. That will be up next time.

Until then, happy modeling!
