Welcome back to the Scenic Ridge build out. If you remember from [my last post]({% post_url 2024-01-07-scenic-ridge-29 %}), which was almost a month ago, I needed to ballast the track.

Well, it took longer than I expected.  Some of that is because I detest ballasting.  You'd think that, with all the other innovations coming out, someone would have invented an "easy ballasting machine" - one you could hook up to a train that put the ballast of choice exactly where it was needed and glued it down for you.  No such luck, so I did a little bit each day.

I did end up running out of the supplied ballast.  This was no doubt due to my little extra spur, but also because I was using too much ballast early on and I ran ballast slightly too far inside the tunnels.  In any case, the extra ballast was purchased from my local train store (Eastside Trains in Kirkland, WA) and cost $6.95.

Another reason for it taking so long was that I was having fun with my resin 3D printer - the Elegoo Saturn 3 Ultra.  Specifically, I've been downloading buildings that have no reason to be in a model railway - they are more suited for fantasy role playing games or Warhammer 40K.  However, when scaled down appropriately, they make good little buildings that I can paint.  

I've currently got two buildings that I printed.  The first is a windmill:

And the second is for a little viking house:

You can also see an unpainted roadside inn on the layout above.  This has been primed in black.  My next job on that building is to build up some highlights with light grey and white dry brushing, then I'll use my acrylic paints to give it some color.  That will be shown complete some other time.  I'm experimenting with the right painting process right now.  The windmill was primed in grey and then painted with acrylic paints suitable for miniatures, whereas the viking house was primed in white and painted with craft acrylic paints.  I then went over some of the details later on with metallic acrylics from my miniatures set of paints.

Next up, I'm going to lay down some "turf", which will make the mountains (finally) interesting.  I'll also be building up some more houses for my town area.  So until next time, happy modeling!
