It's been a couple of days since my last update.  I had to go to my local hobby store because the track bed supplied in the kit ran out.  While I was there, I also purchased a [Xuron 2175B track cutter](https://www.amazon.com/Xuron-2175B-Semi-Flush-Shear/dp/B000IBOOU8/) since I needed one and they were the same price as online.

On to the track laying.  Same as before - put some tacky glue down.  Wait for a couple of minutes for it to become tacky, then put the track down, and finally secure it with some foam tacks.

There were two problem areas.  The right hand cross-over points didn't quite fit.  Also, the connection to the bridge ended up a little too far over, resulting in a very small gap.  Here, I fixed two birds with one stone, or maybe two gaps with one piece of track.  I cut a small amount of track from a 5" piece of straight track to make the cross-over work.  Then I soldered the remaining track to the bridge, allowing it to extend just a little bit more to fit.

Here is the bridge:

I've noticed one joint where the joiner didn't go onto the rail properly.  I'll fix that once the glue is dried.  I've done that repair before when I was doing the tunnel laying.

That's it for this weekend.  Next, I'm going to wire up the power to the whole layout so I can run some trains before moving onto painting and ballasting.  Until then, happy modeling!
