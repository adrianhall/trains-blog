Finally, I am getting to building the landscape.  To catch you up from [last time]({% post_url 2023-10-22-scenic-ridge-16 %}), I glued down the platforms and used some of the risers to create the roadbed that will be created later on.  The next step is to "wad up some newspaper, then put plaster cloth over the top."  I've used the plaster cloth before, so no surprises there.  The wads are temperamental.  I don't like using them.  They make laying the plaster cloth neatly next to impossible.

Anyhow, I started at the lower tunnel entrance, since that's where the diagram started.

This was a bad place to start.  I needed to get used to laying out this plaster cloth and the right amount of newspaper to go underneath.  I had to use three or four layers of the plaster cloth to get the look right.  Using smaller pieces (maybe 3 inches square) worked the best here.  After I got that corner half done, I started working my way along the front of the layout.

Obviously, I'm going to get my sanding block out to smooth out the track bed before I begin laying track.

I found the best technique was to lay the newspaper wads down, then go along with a single layer of plaster cloth that had been dipped in the water.  I tried the spray bottle - good for flat surfaces, but not so good for the crinkly stuff.  Wearing the nitrile gloves helped here. I smoothed the first layer as best I could.  By the time I got to the far end, the area where I started had dried sufficiently that I could go over it with another layer of the plaster cloth.  This time, it was easier to smooth out and make an actual surface.

I think doing the pink foam carving and mod podge sealer is a better idea.  That gave me the idea of using the off-cuts of the pink foam I used for the risers as fill ins.  I tried that out at the far end of the layout, and it worked "better".  It wasn't a total win.  I think if I had started with pink foam and carving, it would have been better.  However, having the pink foam off cuts underneath the newspaper made the whole mess less squishy and easier to work.

I've obviously got a lot still to do hear, so I'll see you in a few days (since I won't complete this in one evening).  Until next time, happy modeling!
