Well, let's just say that my plan for the track wiring did not go well.  So I ripped it all out and started over with a different thing.  Specifically, I purchased some [Screw Terminal Strip Blocks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CLW5FPS) that came with a bunch of bus bars.  I screwed them to the underside of the layout and then wired all the feeder wires to the strip blocks.

There were a total of four feeder wires - two on the main line (one in between the points and one outside the points) and then two on the siding (at either end).  I worked out that the solid core wire that I had made for a great hole feeder.  So I made a little tool.  I enlarged the hole underneath the layout slightly.  Then I taped the stranded 18AWG wire to the solid core tool and threaded it up from the bottom of the layout.  Once through the hole, I soldered it to the track.

(With apologies for the fuzzy picture - focusing on something this small is hard!)

Once that was done, I ran a train over it to make sure the connection was good.  Most of the time, I needed a little bit of track cleaning.  Then I ran the train around the loop, through the points - basically all over the place.

Then I thought I should run some rolling stock as well.  That didn't go so well.

The one on the left is a Rapido coupler.  It is pretty much universal when you buy second hand cars.  The one on the right is an Accumate coupler - common on newer locomotives from Atlas, which this one is.  I can't connect the cars to the locomotive.  What I've decided to do is to buy a sampler set of trucks from Micro Trains.  The sampler set comes with a long, medium, and short coupler, and you just swap out the trucks on the car you want to convert.  Since Accumate supposedly mates with Micro Trains couplers, I should be good to go here.

Of course, now I have to wait a few days for the couplers to arrive.  So that's another blog post!  Until next time, happy modeling!
