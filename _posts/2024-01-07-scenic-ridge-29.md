Welcome back to the Scenic Ridge build out.  It was Christmas and I spent some time with the family rather than concentrating on the modeling.  However, I did get one thing done during the break, which is my first building.  I decided to do some papercraft.  Basically, you download an image or a PDF from the Internet (and there are several sites to choose from), then print it on 200 lb card stock. Cut it out, score the fold lines, and stick it together.  I used tacky glue to do the sticking and an xacto #2 blade for the cutting and scoring.

As you can see, there are a few problems.  Firstly, there is no base.  I took a piece of thin foam board and painted it the same color as my base coat on the model.  After it dried, I glued the building to the base.

Finally, there are a number of white lines where I scored and then folded the model.  White lines are ugly.  I used a water color pen that I picked up from the local art store to disguise the white line.

I like the resulting finish.  I was going to try my hand at various other building techniques - scratch build, 3D print, etc.  Having seen how easy these are to put together, I think the majority of my buildings will be paper craft.  Some great (free) sites I've found for this:

* [Papermau](https://papermau.tumblr.com/)
* [Card models by Tony](http://cardmodelsbytony.weebly.com/)
* [Wordsworth Model Railway](http://www.wordsworthmodelrailway.co.uk/)

I've also found a few online resources where you can get the PDF for a small amount of cash ([Dave Graffam Models](http://davesgames.net/) is my favorite as it gets into really old looking buildings).

One killer hint is to find something you like that's bigger than what you want.  I model N scale, but the pub I intend to put together next is HO scale.  I printed a page from the new model on my regular paper and measured the height of the door on the page.  In my case, it was 22mm.  On my N scale model, a door is 12mm.  Once I've got these numbers, I calculated the ratio (12mm divided by 22mm is 0.55).  When I printed the sheets for the new model on cardstock, I scaled to 0.55.  The model comes out at the right size.

Next up on the model railway is ballasting.  It isn't one of my favorite things, so I think I'll just get on with it!
