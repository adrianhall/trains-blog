Now that I have laid some track, run a locomotive, and (most importantly) confirmed that the positions of the risers is correct according to the plan, todays task involves pinning down the base risers and then gluing them in place. The track plan calls for two levels of risers.  The bottom level (todays project) is all one size - about two inches tall.  The second level (which I picked up before starting) is what I was using to test the track layout out.

I'm going to do this in phases - roughly three pieces of riser material at a time.  First off, I pin some down:

Every video that I found on Youtube suggested starting this bit at the bridge. I looked at all those videos and thought that the various ends of the risers tended to end up on a curve.  So I started my first set of risers in the middle of an outside curve.  I then went two risers worth in one direction and one in the other direction to complete the curve.  As I suspected, the joins between risers all happened to be on straight areas.  Will this continue?  I have no idea, but it bodes well.

I also pinned more on the inside curve than the outside curve (although I do pin both sides).  The inside curve needs to hold the position for the rest of the installation to work.

Once that is done, it's time to heat up the glue gun (on low) and start gluing this down.  Woodland Scenics has [a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqSYNabQl6I) on how to do this, but you basically follow the contours of the riser, including inside the riser where possible.

My Gorilla glue gun has a Low/High switch on the handle.  Inserting the glue sticks is easy enough.  Just give it enough time to heat up before starting. This process eats through glue sticks incredibly fast.  I definitely need to order more glue sticks to complete the job. A set of three risers consumed 8 sticks of glue.  Thankfully, Amazon delivers overnight, so I can complete the process (and this blog) when it arrives.

Once glued, let the glue dry completely before removing the pins and moving on to the next section. Experience says the glue dries in about 8-10 minutes.  Around about this point, I realized having a container for the glue sticks is "A Good Idea&trademark;"  I fetched a takeout container (of which I have plenty) for holding the glue sticks.

When I got to the inside track, I really wondered how they expected me to glue the base down.  Also, why did they tell us to use a glue gun instead of foam tack?  Oh well.  Some questions will have to go unanswered.  My answer was to glue the inside track to the outside track.  The whole of the base will be solid even if that particular bit wasn't.

This was also the point at which I ran out of glue sticks.  Still - more are coming in the morning...

... and this is what the first set of risers looks like when the complete riser lengths are in place.

The final bits (the end of the track and the gaps in the middle) require less than a riser length. To do these, first I placed the riser at the end of one, then marked (with a foam pen) where I needed to cut to make it fit. Once that was done, I used the foam cutter to cut the piece to size.  Finally, I tacked it and glued it in.

Having gone through this, I feel the methodology for gluing this stuff down.  I feel you want a secure bond like the Titebond - it takes longer to dry, but it is more secure.  Whether Titebond is the right glue for foam on foam or if you want to use foam tack glue instead is another thing to consider.  Some experimentation is required, I feel.  For the top section, I might try putting the Titebond on the bottom of the riser, then pin it to ensure it holds the position, and finally glue the edges as before.  I feel this will give me the best result, especially considering how close some of the risers are to each other.

Next up is installing the second level of risers and the overpass (that will be inside the tunnel).  Until then, happy modeling!
