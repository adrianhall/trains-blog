I've recently been building a new train layout and I wanted to use [DCC-EX](https://dcc-ex.com), which requires an Arduino Mega2560 board, a Motor shield, and a Wi-Fi shield.  A number of boards, including the titular [Songhe board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07THDDFSJ) come with Wi-Fi on the board, meaning I don't actually need a separate shield.  This is a win!

Unfortunately, when the board arrived, it didn't even get recognized by the PC for programming it.  I needed to re-flash it with a boot loader that actually works.  Doubly unfortunately, the documentation for the process, not to mention the files needed, are hard to find.  Triply unfortunately, the prescribed method that I found first because it was most prominent didn't work.

So, here is the mechanism that worked for me.

## Step 1: Download the files you will need

You need a flash downloader and the appropriate flash files.  You can download the flash downloader from [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools).  Note that this only works on a Windows PC.

The flash files themselves [are available on GitHub](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_NONOS_SDK), also from Espressif.  When you get to the GitHub page, click on **Code**, then **Download ZIP**.

You now have two ZIP files. Unpack them using your favorite tool (including the one built into Windows).

You will also want to download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to make sure your board is finally recognized!

## Step 2: Become familiar with your Arduino board

Let's take a look at the Arduino board to start with:

![The Arduino Mega2560 + Wi-Fi R3 Board](/assets/2023/0929/img1.jpg)

Note the three highlighted areas:

* In the middle are the _DIP switches_.  These are likely covered by a small plastic film when you get the board.  Remove the film.  If the DIP switch is up, it's ON; if it's down, then it's OFF.
* Slightly above the DIP switches is the _MODE switch_.
* Slightly below and to the right of the DIP switches is the _Wi-Fi communications port selector_. If the switch is up, it's set to RXD0/TXD0; if the switch is down, it's set to RXD3/TXD3.

I'll refer to these specific buttons in the instructions below.  When moving the DIP switches, I use a 1.4MM jewelers flat-head screw driver.  You could use a small pair of tweezers or similar as well.

Note that I've got my board plugged into my computer in the picture using a MicroUSB to USB-C cable I happen to have.  You don't need an external power supply for this.

## Step 3: Set up the Arduino for flashing

To set up the Arduino for flashing:

* Unplug your Arduino board from the USB cable.
* Move the _Wi-Fi communications port selector_ to RXD3/TXD3.
* Ensure all the _DIP switches_ are in the OFF position.
* Turn the 5, 6, and 7 _DIP switches_ to ON.
* Plug your Arduino board into the USB cable.  The green LED will come on.
* Press the _MODE button_.

## Step 4: Flash the Arduino memory

To erase the Arduino memory:

* Start the `flash_download_tool_3.9.5.exe`.
* Select `ESP8266` and `Develop` from the drop-downs.

This will bring up a rather intimidating looking screen, with no details on it.  Yes, this is where most people will go wrong.

![The Flash Download Tool main page](/assets/2023/0929/img3.png)

Let's split this into three areas:

1. At the bottom (next to the START/STOP/ERASE) is the COM and BAUD settings.  This is the communications port that is used to communicate with the Arduino board.
2. In the middle is the SPIFlashConfig section. Set these to:
   * SPI SPEED = 40MHz
   * SPI MODE = DIO
   * `DoNotChgBin` is checked
3. At the top is a list of files and the memory locations they will be flashed to.  All the files are in the `ESP8266_NONOS_SDK-master` directory that was created when you downloaded the GitHub repository.  More on this later.

Let's find out our COM setting.  Open up Device Manager (search for it if you don't know where it is), then expand the **Ports (COM & LPT)** section.  You are looking for something called `USB-SERIAL CH340`.

![The Device Manager showing the USB-SERIAL port](/assets/2023/0929/img4.png)

On mine, this is **COM4**.  Yours may be different, since it's dependent on your computer.  Select this value in the COM drop-down of the Flash Download Tool. Make sure the BAUD is set to 115200 (which is the default).

Finally, we need to put values in the matrix at the top.  For each file mentioned below, click on the `...` to open a file browser, and find the file (the path given is relative to the top of the GitHub repository directory), then click **Open**.  Enter the address provided in the right hand box, then check the box to the left.

| File                                    | Address  |
|+========================================|+=========|
| `bin/boot_v1.7.bin`                     | 0x000000 |
| `bin/at/1024+1024/user1.2048.new.5.bin` | 0x001000 |
| `bin/esp_init_data_default_v08.bin`     | 0x1FC000 |
| `bin/blank.bin`                         | 0x0FE000 |
| `bin/blank.bin`                         | 0x1FE000 |

Once you are done, your window will look something like this:

![The Flash Download Tool main page - configured](/assets/2023/0929/img5.png)

If you like, you can erase the flash memory first - click on **ERASE**.  However, it isn't needed.

To flash the memory, press **START**.

The flash download tool opens up a terminal window so you can see what is going on.  You will see something like the following:

```text

```

This doesn't take very long - if you get to 10 minutes and see lots of dots, something has gone wrong.  Make sure that this process completes to the very end before continuing.

## Step 4: Switch your Arduino to running mode

Now you want to switch your Arduino back into normal or running mode.  To do this:

* Unplug your Arduino from the USB cable.
* Turn all the _DIP switches_ off, except 3 and 4 (which should be turned on).
* Leave the _Wi-Fi communications port selector_ set to RXD3/TXD3.

Now, plug the Arduino board back into your PC and start the Arduino IDE. In the **Select Board** drop-down, select your COM port (the one you discovered in the Device Manager).

![The Select Board drop-down in the Arduino IDE](/assets/2023/0929/img6.png)

In the **Search board** box, enter **Mega**, then select the **Arduino Mega or Mega 2560**.  Then click on **OK**.

Now, click on the Upload button (it looks like a right arrow) to compile and upload the sample sketch to your Arduino board.  It should complete without errors.

If you are unsure it completed without errors, go to **File** > **Preferences...**, and turn on **Show verbose output during...** > **upload**.  Then repeat the process.  You will see something similar to the following:

You are now ready to use the board!
