I've recently been building a new train layout and I wanted to use [DCC-EX](https://dcc-ex.com), which requires an Arduino Mega2560 board, a Motor shield, and a Wi-Fi shield.  A number of boards, including the titular [Songhe board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07THDDFSJ) come with Wi-Fi on the board, meaning I don't actually need a separate shield.  This is a win!

Unfortunately, when the board arrived, it didn't even get recognized by the PC for programming it.  I needed to re-flash it with a boot loader that actually works.  Doubly unfortunately, the documentation for the process, not to mention the files needed, are hard to find.  Triply unfortunately, the prescribed method that I found first because it was most prominent didn't work.

So, here is the mechanism that worked for me.

## Step 1: Download the files you will need

You need a flash downloader and the appropriate flash files.  You can download the flash downloader from [DCC-EX](https://dcc-ex.com/_static/files/esp8266/flash_download_tool_v3.8.5.zip), but there are other flash download tools that work as well.  Note that this only works on a Windows PC.

The flash files themselves [are available on DCC-EX](https://dcc-ex.com/_static/files/esp8266/ESP8266_NonOS_AT_Bin_V1.7.4.zip) for the precise version that DCC-EX supports, or you can download the v1.7 version from [the Espressif GitHub repo](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_NONOS_SDK).  When you get to the GitHub page, click on **Code**, then **Download ZIP**.

You now have two ZIP files. Unpack them using your favorite tool (including the one built into Windows).

You will also want to download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to make sure your board is finally recognized!

## Step 2: Become familiar with your Arduino board

Let's take a look at the Arduino board to start with:

![The Arduino Mega2560 + Wi-Fi R3 Board](/assets/2023/09/29/img1.jpg)

Note the three highlighted areas:

* In the middle are the _DIP switches_.  These are likely covered by a small plastic film when you get the board.  Remove the film.  If the DIP switch is up, it's ON; if it's down, then it's OFF.
* Slightly above the DIP switches is the _MODE switch_.
* Slightly below and to the right of the DIP switches is the _Wi-Fi communications port selector_. If the switch is up, it's set to RXD0/TXD0; if the switch is down, it's set to RXD3/TXD3.

I'll refer to these specific buttons in the instructions below.  When moving the DIP switches, I use a 1.4MM jewelers flat-head screw driver.  You could use a small pair of tweezers or similar as well.

Note that I've got my board plugged into my computer in the picture using a MicroUSB to USB-C cable I happen to have.  You don't need an external power supply for this.

## Step 3: Set up the Arduino for flashing

To set up the Arduino for flashing:

* Unplug your Arduino board from the USB cable.
* Move the _Wi-Fi communications port selector_ to RXD3/TXD3.
* Ensure all the _DIP switches_ are in the OFF position.
* Turn the 5, 6, and 7 _DIP switches_ to ON.
* Plug your Arduino board into the USB cable.  The green LED will come on.
* Press the _MODE button_.

## Step 4: Flash the Arduino memory

To erase the Arduino memory:

* Start the `flash_download_tool_3.8.5.exe`.
* Click **Developer Mode**.

  ![Select Developer Mode](/assets/2023/09/29/screenshot-1.png)

* Click **ESP8266 Download Tool**.

  ![Select ESP8266 Download Tool](/assets/2023/09/29/screenshot-2.png)

This will bring up a rather intimidating looking screen, with no details on it.  Yes, this is where most people will go wrong.

![The Flash Download Tool main page](/assets/2023/09/29/img3.png)

Let's split this into three areas:

1. At the bottom (next to the START/STOP/ERASE) is the COM and BAUD settings.  This is the communications port that is used to communicate with the Arduino board.
2. In the middle is the SPIFlashConfig section. Set these to:
   * CrystalFreq = **26M**
   * SPI SPEED = **40MHz**
   * SPI MODE = **DIO**
   * FLASH SIZE = **16Mbit-C1**
3. In the bottom section, set BAUD to **460800**

Let's find out our COM setting.  Open up Device Manager (search for it if you don't know where it is), then expand the **Ports (COM & LPT)** section.  You are looking for something called `USB-SERIAL CH340`.

![The Device Manager showing the USB-SERIAL port](/assets/2023/09/29/img4.png)

On mine, this is **COM4**.  Yours may be different, since it's dependent on your computer.  Select this value in the COM drop-down of the Flash Download Tool.

Finally, we need to put values in the matrix at the top.  For each file mentioned below, click on the `...` to open a file browser, and find the file (the path given is relative to the top of the GitHub repository directory), then click **Open**.  Enter the address provided in the right hand box, then check the box to the left.

| File                                    | Address  |
|+========================================|+=========|
| `bin/boot_v1.7.bin`                     | 0x000000 |
| `bin/at/1024+1024/user1.2048.new.5.bin` | 0x001000 |
| `bin/esp_init_data_default_v08.bin`     | 0x1FC000 |
| `bin/blank.bin`                         | 0x0FE000 |
| `bin/blank.bin`                         | 0x1FE000 |

Once you are done, your window will look something like this:

![The Flash Download Tool main page - configured](/assets/2023/09/29/img5.png)

First, erase the memory, press **ERASE**.  This only takes a couple of seconds.

Once erasure is complete, flash the memory, press **START**.

The flash download tool opens up a terminal window so you can see what is going on.  You will see something like the following:

```text
.Uploading stub...
Running stub...
Stub running...
Changing baud rate to 460800
Changed.
-----------------------
crc_efuse_4bit: 0
crc_calc_4bit: 7
48bit mac

 is stub and send flash finish
```

This doesn't take very long - if you get to 5 minutes and see lots of dots, something has gone wrong.  Make sure that this process completes to the very end before continuing.

## Step 4: Switch your Arduino to running mode

Now you want to switch your Arduino back into normal or running mode.  To do this:

* Unplug your Arduino from the USB cable.
* Turn all the _DIP switches_ off.
* Turn _DIP switches_ 1, 2, 3, and 4 on.
* Leave the _Wi-Fi communications port selector_ set to RXD3/TXD3.

Now, plug the Arduino board back into your PC and start the Arduino IDE. In the **Select Board** drop-down, select your COM port (the one you discovered in the Device Manager).

![The Select Board drop-down in the Arduino IDE](/assets/2023/09/29/img6.png)

In the **Search board** box, enter **Mega**, then select the **Arduino Mega or Mega 2560**.  Then click on **OK**.

Now, click on the Upload button (it looks like a right arrow) to compile and upload the sample sketch to your Arduino board.  It should complete without errors.

If you are unsure it completed without errors, go to **File** > **Preferences...**, and turn on **Show verbose output during...** > **upload**.  Then repeat the process.  You will see something similar to the following:

You are now ready to use the board!
