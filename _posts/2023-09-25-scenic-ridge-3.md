Today, the Scenic Ridge scenery pack arrived, and it is a huge box!

The box holds a tray (which was a joy to get out - I ended up cutting the box up) with all the stuff in it:

I have to wait a little longer for the other tools and parts I want, but I can at least get going with assembly by laying down the foam board that acts as the base.  Remember I mentioned that the wood was cut a little large?  Well, it turns out the foam board isn't exactly 3'x6' either. If I want to center the layout on the baseboard, I need to do some maths.  Here are the tools I am using today:

I had all these on hand:

* A tape measure small enough to be useful.  This one is a 12' model from Park Tools that I use with my bike.
* A [rafters square](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Empire-12-in-Magnum-Aluminum-Rafter-Square-3990/100174397)
* A #2B pencil (which was what I had on hand).
* The Titebond wood glue I used to assemble the baseboard.
* The damp cloth I used in assembling the baseboard.

The thing I left in the picture is the foam tacks that came in the Scenic Ridge kit.  I didn't end up using those for this step.

Measuring the baseboard, it was 74" by 37 3/4".  The foam boards are 71" by 35 3/4".  That's a different of 2 1/2" on the long direction and 2" on the short direction.  And that equates (divide by 2) to 1 1/4" on the ends and 1" on the sides.  Once I had that, I used the square to mark accurate guides on the baseboard top to line up one end, put down a bunch of glue to ensure the foam board was laid down properly, and stuck it down.

Then I waited before doing the next board.  During drying, the boards can shift.  I don't want them to move, so it's better to just let the glue dry - I waited about 30 minutes before starting the next foam board. For the next board, it's more important that the lines on the board line up, so I made that my guide.  I drew lines at the other side to show where the second board ended, lifted the board up, laid glue down, and then put the board down again, taking care to line up the lines on the board again.  Repeat for the final board.  Once done, you'll have something like this:

All told, it was something like 20 minutes work.  However, it was spread over a whole evening to allow time for drying.  As much as I want to get started on laying the track risers out (which is the next step), I'll [leave that for next time]({% post_url 2023-09-26-scenic-ridge-4 %}).
