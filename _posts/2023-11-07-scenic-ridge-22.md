Welcome back to the layout.  Today, the glue for the track has cured and it is time to wire the track to some power so I can run some trains.  Let me be honest straight up front.  Waiting this long for wiring is a mistake.  I should have done it much earlier.  Then again, there are many things I would have done differently in hindsight, so I'm not that worried about it. 

To start with, I purchased a 12" long drill bit (3/32" size) to drill some holes throuhg the scenary and baseboard next to the track.  Since the flexible cable I was going to use for this would not stay straight enough to feed through (one of the problems I could have avoided by doing this step earlier), I opted for the solid core wires that I had on hand.

Try to get the wires as close to the track as possible.  Bend the end of the wire so it's laying alongside the outside of the track, then solder it in place.

Yes, I really didn't make these neat.  I need to practice.  I rubbed the top of the rail down with my track eraser, which will hopefully do a good job of smoothing out the bumps.  

Moving my attention to the bottom of layout, I've got a set of 18AWG wires running the length of the layout. The next step is to connect the feeder wires to the bus-wires. Just make sure red matches with red and black with black so you don't end up crossing polarity and causing a short.

I had planned on using little connectors called T-Taps.  However, getting those working with the solid core wires proved difficult.  So I switched over to stripping a little bit of insulation off the bus wires, then soldering the feeder wires to the bus wires.  Finally wrap each joint in some electrical tape to ensure that shorts don't happen.  Not the neatest method, but I'll figure out a better method for my next layout.

Once the connections are made with the DCC-EX box, it's time to run some trains!  And once I've validated this first feeder wire works, I can move onto the next one and repeat the process all over again.

Until next time, happy modeling!
