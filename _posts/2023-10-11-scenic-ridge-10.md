The story so far.  I've laid down plaster cloth in the tunnel areas, then glued the track bed down.  Today, I'm laying track.  But first, I'm going to solder the track joints.  The reason for this is simple.  Once the tunnels are actually covered up, there is limited opportunity to correct the positioning of the track or solve track connectivity issues.  Soldering the track joints ensures that there is electrical conductivity between adjacent sections of track.

I did purchase a [soldering kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BL339LX/) that contains both 60/40 rosin core solder and the flux paste necessary for the job.  The kit also came with a couple of tiny screw drivers and a couple of bits of wire - practice, I guess!  Here are the tools you need:

As you can see, I've got the solder and flux, a nice soldering iron stand (which I did buy from Amazon) and a soldering iron with a nice fine tip (which I already had from some previous electronics work). To complete this, I first of all split the track sections that are going inside the tunnels into pieces that will fit on the board, and I started heating the iron.

My iron doesn't tell me what temperature it is, so I just waited 10 minutes or so.  Once hot, I tinned the tip (which, basically, is applying solder to the tip to ensure it is up to temperature.  Once you have it melting, coat the tip and then wipe off the excess by scraping the tip across the brass cleaner in the little pot).

Turning my attention to the track, I applied flux to all the joints on the outside track:

Then get a piece of solder in one hand and your soldering iron in the other.  Apply the soldering iron to the rail to heat it up, then bring the solder to it and spread the solder over the joint.  It will get sucked into the gap.  Make sure there is no solder on the top or inside of the rail.  You only want it on the outside of the rail.

I went around all the outside joints, then turned the track around and did all the inside track.  Don't do this standing up.  Make sure you are nice and comfortable when doing this so you don't slip and make a mistake.

Once the soldering is done, turn your attention back to track laying.  First off, test-fit the track one more time.  I noticed that my soldering had moved the track alignment around - not significantly, but enough that I wanted to adjust things.  Then I took it up again and laid down a bead of foam tack glue.  I also placed some glue on the card I was using and wiped it down the length of the underside of the track.  Once it became tacky, I laid it down and positioned it where it needed to go.

Since there was some movement and "lift" from the track, I used foam pins on the outside of the track to keep it in place laterally, and pins pushed all the way down in the middle to hold the track down until the glue dried.

Now that I've got the outer loop done, I just need to do the inner loop (no photos - it's the same process).  Then I'll test run the trains again before wrapping for tonight.

Next time, I'm going to be ballasting the track near the entrance of the tunnels, which should be fun.  Until then, happy modeling!
