I took a bit of a change of pace recently.  I'd actually gotten bored of the incessant white landscaping, so I figured I would "do something else" for a while.  One of the things I wanted to do was to replace the couplers on my rolling stock.  My locomotive (yes, I only have one) has an Accumate coupler on it.  The rolling stock, for the most part, has Rapido couplers.  Since Accumate and Micro Trains couplers are compatible, I figured I would swap the Rapido couplers for the MTL couplers.  So I ordered a "sampler" package of couplers - two different styles (Bettendorf and Roller Bearing) in three different coupler lengths for each.  Here is how they arrived:

Micro Trains also included the re-railer, which comes in handy.  I decided to mount the roller bearing couplers first.  Here they are unpacked.

As you can see, there is a pair of trucks in each length, plus enough gizmos to theoretically fit on any car you have.  I opted for a weathered hopper first, since it was the easiest.  After I took the Rapido trucks off (they just pulled off), I just needed a center pin that fit.  Put the truck over the hole (making sure it's the right way up) and push the pin through until it's secure.  Make sure the truck can swivel once done.  Some other trucks require one of the bushings or a different center pin.  It just depends.  One of my trucks didn't have a center pin that fit at all - still figuring out what to do about that one.

Since I have so many Rapido couplers, I decided to make a couple of my cars "conversion cars".  There will be an MTL coupler on one end and a Rapido coupler on the other.

A couple of tips:

1. The little widgets that come with the couplers will fly off in random directions at times as you try to fit them.  Make sure you are working in a place where small black widgets show up, since they will fall on the floor.
2. I found a set of reverse tweezers (like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Yakamoz-Precision-Non-Conductive-Resistant-Anti-Magnetic)) worked really well for positioning and holding the very small widgets that hold the truck to the car.
3. Light is important.  I used an LED headlamp that I use for walking my dog at night to illuminate the truck and car so I could see where the widgets needed to go.

Now, I need to crack on and get another couple of trucks fitted.  Until next time, happy modeling!
