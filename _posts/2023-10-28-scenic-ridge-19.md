This is a quick update on progress.  Over the last few days, I've laid down most of the plaster cloth that is supplied with the kit.  Some of it has been in big strips, laid with the aid of a spray bottle that has been liberally applied.  This allows me to get a good chunk of the layout and edges done quickly.

As you can see, the mountain is roughed in, and most of the track is covered.  I had to do a few more road adjustments.  Today, I added a small incline to the left hand side (leading from the tracks to the platform), and then a small incline to the right side (leading from the center track to the town area).  These have been glued down and are waiting for the glue to dry before I plaster them.

I don't like how the tunnel entrances turned out.  Tunnels tend to go through cuttings before going into the tunnel.  The layout doesn't allow that, so they still look weird to me.  

Tomorrow, I'm going to finish off the plaster cloth.  I'm running out anyhow.  I definitely don't have enough plaster cloth to do the outside of the layout.  I'll do the corners, but I'll just paint the rest of the outside with a latex primer from the hardware store at some point.  That can wait until the end of the project though.

And yes - the track will need cleaning.  I'm going to use isopropyl alcohol for this (which I have on hand for other stuff), but I'm not going to do that until all the plaster is laid.  I should have covered it - I didn't, and that's a lesson learned.

Until next time, happy modeling!
