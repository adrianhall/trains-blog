The next phase in my scenery building for the Scenic Ridge layout is the "mounting" of the rocks on the layout.  The instructions say to mix some more hydrocal (but make it thicker), cut into the plaster cloth to make it flat, and then use the hydrocal to mount the rocks.  However, this assumes that the basic structure is convex - it bows outward.  Part of mine, at least the parts where I want to mount the rocks, are the other way.  So I decided to buy some pink spackle and use that as modelling clay on the back.  When the spackle dries, it turns from pink into white and acts as a glue as well.  I can form the interface to the plaster cloth with my fingers.

Here is a look at the first rock I mounted:

As you can see, I need to do some basic touch up - the black wash around the raised bit and then the golden base color around the edges.  Also, the rock cracked while I was installing it - not a big deal, but these castings are fragile.  Just squeeze it together while you are installing the rock pieces and you will be fine.

Yes, this is a short update.  I need to get on and install the other five rocks now.

Until next time, happy modeling!
