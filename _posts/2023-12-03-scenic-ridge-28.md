Welcome to the next installment of Scenic Ridge.  Today, I am using the Woodland Scenics [Smooth-it](https://woodlandscenics.woodlandscenics.com/show/item/ST1452) to create a road across my main village area.  This is supposedly an easy way to create roads.  Personally, I've only ever used sandpaper in the past, which (after spray painting black) makes a really good road surface.  However, Smooth-it came in the Scenic Ridge kit, so I figured I might as well try it.

The first step is to lay down a barrier.  I guess the Smooth-it, once it's mixed, will flow all over the place otherwise.

The white strips come in the kit as a big roll with a sticky back.  You peel the covering of the sticky back and stick them in place.  The advantage of this is that you can easily stretch them out and get straight lines (which you could with the sandpaper method as well).  However, you can also curve them with an assist (which was difficult with the sandpaper method).  Then, you mix up the Smooth-it - 2 parts mix to 1 part water.  This looks like Hydrocal in that it is a white powdery thing mixed with water.  Once you've mixed it, you pour it into the barrier, then use the provded scraper to smooth the edges.  You don't have much time to do this, so I didn't capture any photos.  However, here is my first attempt.

Verdict - what a mess! It's not easier, nor cleaner, nor anything.  It just produces a gloopy mess that is hard to impossible to get into the right place.  I think it's actually just cheap poly-filler mix.  After fiddling with the ratio (it's not 2:1 - I took a look at a poly-filler box and it was like 1.5:1), I came up with something that wasn't too runny nor too thick to spread.  I then put it on a palette knife to do the main spreading.  Finally, the spreader makes sense and can put it into the right place.  Once done, I used my palette knife to clean off the excess that was outside of the barrier.  This gave me a flat road.

Sorry Woodland Scenics - this Smooth-it is a bust.

However, I now have a road. It needs a little sanding, but that can be done after it dries.

The Scenic Ridge package has paints for tarmac and concrete, so I'll paint it once it is dry.  Smooth-it is being consigned to the rubbish bin as a failure though.  It's a horrible product.  I am using the rest of this to build up the road that leads down to the tracks.  Once that dries, I'll sand it down and then use the same mix for dealing with the track crossing.  This seems to be a reasonable place to use the Smooth-it mix.  However, for basic roads, I'm going back to sand paper.

Until next time, happy modeling!
