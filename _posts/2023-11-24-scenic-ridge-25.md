For those of you not in the US, yesterday was Thanksgiving - a great day off to spend with family, which I did.  Today, I also had a day off work so I went down to the hardware store to get some paint for the base coat.  I also mixed the pygments for the paints in the Scenic Ridge set so I could paint the rocks.

First the rocks.  I followed the instructions, mostly.  I put a few dropd of the burnt umber pygment into my palette followed by a bunch of water (they suggest 1 part pygment to 8 parts water, which worked for me).  Then I used a sponge to stipple the rocks with the color.  I repeated the process with the earty brown color.  Finally, I mixed the entire contents of the black pygment with 16 parts water so I could do a wash.  I actually think they came out ok.

Then I turned my attention to the layout itself and put down a base coat.  The instructions show that you should put down a base coat that is pretty light.  Almost everyone I talked to suggested the kit didn't contain enough, and I wanted something a little thicker so that I could cover up some of the little pinprick holes I have on the much hated plaster cloth.  So I headed down to the hardware store and picked up a half-pint of a golden sandy matte color.  The half-pint is called a "sample size" in paint land.  I also picked up a 2" cheap brush and used that for the bulk of the coverage.

Now, a half pint was not enough.  I used just about an entire pint of paint on the layout.  At the end of painting, I had enough for touch-ups later on.  Since the pints were almost exactly twice the cost of the half pints, I don't think I lost anything.  I also picked up a half pint of black paint to cover the outside of the layout, which I will do later with a roller.

Finally, don't worry too much if you paint the edges of the track bed.  It's not a big deal because you are going to be ballasting the track and that will cover up any spots you accidentally painted.  DO worry about getting paint on the track or the point mechanisms.  I stopped what I was doing and wiped those spots immediately with a wet rag.  Later on, I'll go over those spots with alcohol on a q-tip and then rub it down with the track eraser to ensure it is clean.

Until next time, happy modeling!
