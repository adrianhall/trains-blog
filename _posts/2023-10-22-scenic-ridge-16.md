Before I can start modeling the mountains, I am meant to fill in the big gaps in the middle of the layout with foam board.  The instructions suggest that you use scraps to raise the platform up to the level of the train tracks, then cut an appropriate 1/2 inch thick foam board to size to stack on top of the risers.  I don't feel this is sturdy enough for my layout, and I wanted to see what XPS foam boards were like to model with.  I went out to my local hardware store and purchased several 2ft x 2ft XPS foam "project panels".

I can stack three of them up in each well and they will do for the supports.  The instructions do note that I need to leave about two inches in the front and towards the center, to allow for the road system to be laid (and instead to put together a bed for the road system)  I think I can do this with what I have.  To carve the right shape, I used a sheet of brown paper that I got in one of the many packages I received and made a quick template.

Then I cut the foam.  The foam is easier to cut.  In fact, this foam can be cut with a suitable utility knife rather easily.  Unfortunately, my utility knife is only half-inch long, so I can't cut the foam all the way through.  This is when I reverted to the hot foam knife.  I also used the hot foam knife to trim up the edges.  There were several places where my template had not done a good job of measuring the gap, so I had to make some more cut-outs.

Keep the cutouts and scrap pieces as they make great filler for the mountain area.

Once the first piece was laid, I could use *that* as a template for the next piece, which resulted in less shaving later on.  There were four pieces in each well.  Take care on the right hand well as you need to leave room for the roadway.  The other thing to note here is that there are several places where the instructions say "make a 2 inch gap", so you have to cut those out as well.  I didn't allow for that in my template, so I had to cut a little more out.

Here is the effect once complete.

A couple of notes.  Firstly, the cheap Chinese power supply provided with my cheap foam cutter died during this exercise.  If I'm going to be modeling in XPS foam (and I think I am), then I need to invest in some proper tools for handling it.  That's for next time.  Secondly, don't worry about being too accurate.  This is just a platform for your buildings - nothing more.  It will get covered up and plaster cloth will cover up the most egregious mistakes you can think of.  As long as the place you are putting your buildings is flat enough to accommodate them, then you are ok.

I think I'm going to have to put a small piece of foam on the top of the left hand section, but I'm going to leave the other section as is - a little lower than the back track, but a little above the front track.  The village I have in mind sits in the middle.  

All I need to do now is glue these down, then lay some of the risers for the roadbed.  Then I can move onto mountain building.

Until next time, happy modeling!
