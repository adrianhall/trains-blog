The story so far.  I've constructed the tunnel entrances and blocked off the tunnel areas with foam boards.  According to the instructions, the next step is to install the foam boards.  This is a very simple process, but it requires that I stop after gluing them down.

[Profile boards] are interlocking bits of foam that you put around the outside of your layout. The actual process is the same as all the other bits of foam - you position them, cut them to size, hold them in place with foam nails (the little T-pins) and then glue them in place.  Nothing complex here.  In fact, it doesn't even take that long.  the whole process took about an hour (with the bulk of that being measuring, marking, and cutting the boards to size).

This picture was taken immediately before the gluing phase.  I need to make a trim to one corner (the one closest to the camera), but then I'll be done.  After that, I'm going to use the tacky glue to glue each one into place and together, leaving the foam pins in place.  Then tomorrow, once I've let the tacky glue dry, I'll come round with the glue gun to seal the edges.  

Short update, I know - but some things just take time!  Until next time, happy modeling!
