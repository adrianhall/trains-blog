Hello fellow enthusiasts.  Welcome back to my layout.  If you will remember, I've built the baseboard and laid down the foam cover for the layout.  In the interim, some of my ordered tools arrived from Amazon.  First up (and of immediate need) is the [Gorilla dual-temp glue gun](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K791YRP):

Next up is the [Gochange 3 in 1 foam cutter set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H28SCC9):

Finally, I looked up what is needed for [DCC-EX](https://dcc-ex.com), and settled on the following kit:

* [Songhe Mega2560 + WiFi R3 ATmega2560+ESP8266 32Mb Memory](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07THDDFSJ)
* [KOOBOOK L298P Shield R3 Motor Driver Module Expansion Board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y1J34P3)
* [UpBright 16V AC/DC Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0777JDLJ3)
* [12V DC Power Connector 5.5mm x 2.1mm (x10)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C61434H)
* [18 Gauge PVC 1007 Solid Electric Wire Red and Black Each 20 ft](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KFS5342)

I realized that I forgot something to connect to the actual track.  That means I can't run the train even if I had it available. I placed an order for 4 [Atlas N Code 80 Nickel Silver Terminal Joiners](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006O7RA6), which are coming from [Iron Planet Hobbies](https://www.ironplanethobbies.com/) via Amazon. I suspect the locomotive and track pack that I ordered will arrive around the same time.

On to todays task - I need to lay the initial set of risers down onto the foam board.  First off, I grabbed some risers and the foam tack pins, then I pinned the first riser at a starting point.

The risers bend nicely thanks to the spring-like structure. You can pin quite a few in:

... before I realized my somewhat fatal flaw in all this.  I don't want to glue them down until I've put some track down and run a train.  That will allow me to see if the foam is going in the right places.  But the track doesn't arrive until later in the week. So I unpinned them all, and started working on the second level of risers. This will allow me to pin the entire track in one go without having to deal with two levels of risers.  To do this, I had to cut a little bit (with the foam cutter) for where the tracks cross over.  Otherwise, it was uneventful.  Here is the work so far.

Once I've seen the track working and confirm the placement of the risers, I'll unpin all this and re-do the lower level.  There will be another post about that step.

I've got some time before the track and locomotive is due to show up, so [the next post]({% post_url 2023-09-30-dcc-ex %}) is going to be building the [DCC-EX](https://dcc-ex.com) control system.  After that, I'm going to be [laying track down]({% post_url 2023-10-01-scenic-ridge-5 %}) and running a train.
