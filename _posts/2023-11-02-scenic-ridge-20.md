Remember when I laid the track bed, way back [in episode 9]({% post_url 2023-10-06-scenic-ridge-9 %}) - that was almost a month ago.  How time flies.  I now get to do the same thing for the rest of the track.

First, let's take a look at the track, laid down.

Then I outlined the track with pencil, and glued down strips of the track bed with tacky glue and pinned the foam down with foam tacks.  We've seen this step before.

Simple enough.  Unfortunately, the inner loop on the right side was a little too close, so I decided to hold off on laying the track bed there until I could properly measure with all the other bits of track bed I laid.  I also held off on laying the track bed under the cross-over points.  It's going to happen tomorrow (silently).

In the interim (while the glue is curing), I'm going to solder together the tracks into bigger chunks so it's easier to get electrical connectivity long term.  This should be a fun evening!

Until next time, happy modeling!
