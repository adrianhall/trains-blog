This is a super short update!  I should have done this last night when I was doing the profile boards, but I didn't and now I have to wait for glue to dry.  The next step in the process is to cover up the tunnels.  Actually, this didn't go as well as I had hoped.

As you can see, some of the tunnel covers go midway through the access panel holes.  I'll have to do some adjustments - cut a new piece from the bottom and put it in the top, I guess.  It's not a big deal since the extra bit will be covered by the mountain.  It does clarify that I really don't like working with foam this way.  I'd have much preferred stacking up lots of foam and then carving it down.

The next step is to fill in the holes where the flat bits go.  I think I'll do those in pink foam, so a trip to the local hardware store is in order.  I'll be going off script as well.  

Until next time, happy modeling!
