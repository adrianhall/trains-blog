Today, I'm actually constructing tunnels! Step 1 is to create some tunnel facades that will be covered by the tunnel entrances.  Then I'm going to build a few tunnel walls and paint them black. Once that is all glued down and dried, I'll move back to the big projects on the scenery.  But progress will be visible today!

To start with, I had to cut out the tunnel portal template.  This is printed on some paper in the kit.  I don't have an X-Acto knife, nor do I have a self-healing cutting board.  Instead, I have the utility knife and an offcut board from the baseboard build.  Here is the resulting cut-out:

This would have been much easier with the appropriate tools.  As it is, I had to be careful and, somewhat surprisingly, I had to do each cut multiple times to get through the paper.  Maybe my blade in my utility knife needs to be replaced.  I used the metal ruler to ensure that the straight lines were cut straight. I free-handed the curved pieces.

Once this was done, my job was to cut four tunnel portals from the template and a 1/2 inch foam.  My first step was to mark out the squares for each tunnel portal with a foam pen.  Then I use my utility knife to cut those, with the added help of the metal rule.

After the long cut, I realized I should have used the hot foam blade.  It makes much neater cuts.  Don't use the foam knifes - use the hot wire.  The foam knives are too wide to get an accurate cut.  The curved foam wire cutter is much finer.  Once I had four squares, I concentrated on the individual portals.  First, I marked the tunnel portal with a foam pen, then I used the foam hot wire cutter to carve it out.  This was tricky because I do not have the steadiest of hands, which means I prefer having a guide for this. I did the best I could, as the following sequence of photos shows.

As you can probably see, I made a slight error - cutting a chunk out of the side of the portal.  I used the low temp glue gun to glue this back in place.  Since it isn't structural in the final product, I don't think it will make any difference.  I let this sit for thirty minutes to allow the glue to dry.  Finally, I put the template over the portal and did any final carving.

Had I to do this again, I would have glued the template to a piece of card, cut it out with an X-Acto knife and used it as a guide instead of doing all the hacking that I did to try and get a nice curve.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and the right tools would have helped.  Fortunately (for me), there are other, more important carvings to be done in the near future.  I'm going to acquire the right tools and try to do it more accurately.

As you can see from the installation, the next step is to pin the portals in place.  The instructions make a point of saying that the portals protrude over the edges, so no big deal there.

However, the curve on the upper level went perilously close to the edge.  Rather than run the risk of the tunnel portal being too close to the track, I decided to fashion a little bridge that I can pin to.

As you can see, there is plenty of room for the trains to go underneath. Once the bridge is dry, I'll pin the upper level portal to that.  That will make a more solid foundation for the work to come later.  Next, I need to build the inside walls to the tunnel.  The backside of the tunnels will be the profile boards (to be installed next time).  The short version for this is that I need to cut the boards to size, glue them to the right place, then pin them until the glue dries.  The instructions give the size, and the major point is that I have to make sure the top of the walls is level with the top of the portals.

> **Note**: Keep all the scrap foam you cut away to create the tunnels.  They come in useful in other parts of the layout.

The portals on the curved sections needed some adjustments to the instructions to accommodate the bridge I had installed.

Finally, the middle portal needed to have slopes installed.

All of this was using my metal ruler and my trusty hot foam wire cutter (which I am beginning to love!).  Once all the pinning was done, it was a case of gluing each section into place.  I did each portal and the associated walls first, and finished with the long walls.  For each one, I glued the walls with tacky glue, then went around the edges with the hot glue gun.  The portals were glued with just the glue gun.

All that's left to do today is to wait for the glue to dry, then paint the tunnel interior walls black and remove the foam pins. I picked up a bunch of 4oz plastic containers at the local supermarket to hold paints, and the black base paint is provided in the kit. Then I can clean the tracks and run some trains to make sure I didn't screw anything up.

Until next time, happy modeling!
