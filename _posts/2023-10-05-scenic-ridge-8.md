In the [previous step]({% post_url 2023-10-04-scenic-ridge-7 %}), I finally got the risers in place.  The risers form the foundation of the track bed. The next step of the Scenic Ridge process (at least according to the handy manual that comes with it), I need to cut several 4" by 4" squares of plaster cloth, dip them one at a time in water and lay them on top of my risers so that they are butting up against one another and not overlapping.

However, in one place (the overpass), they suggest spraying with a bottle.  Spraying with bottle seems much easier, so I'm going to try that first.

I've taken the track off the layout (again).  Here are the materials:

The roll is actually quite large, so I decided it was better to undercut than overcut.  Once I had a solid pile of strips, I cut those in half.  The roll is 8" wide, so that gave me the 4"x4" (approximately) sheets I needed.  It made a lot of mess though!  The dust got everywhere!

Once I had test-laid a few down (without wetting them), I could see why the bowl of water was necessary.  The spray bottle wouldn't be accurate enough to avoid getting everything else wet as well.  Oh well; time to don the nitrile gloves and get to work.

This went really fast. I figured out that since plaster can be sanded and I am putting another layer on top of this for the track bed, I could actually overlap the sections.  I also felt better about double stacking in some areas on the bend.  It didn't produce a noticeable bump.

When I got to the overpass, I cut a new piece of cardboard, glued it to the foam overpass, and then wrapped the whole thing.  There ended up being a slight bump on either side, so I doubled up the plaster cloth before and after the overpass to make it smooth.

Finally, when I got to the end where I needed to be, I opted for wrapping both sets of risers with one piece of cloth.  I suspect I'll be doing this all the way around eventually, so it doesn't make a lot of sense to leave it off.  Also, there is a positioning problem when the space between the risers gets crowded, so doing it like this avoided the problem.

Now that I have the plaster cloth on, I'll let it dry overnight and take a look at it tomorrow evening.  I'll then sand it with a 120 grade sanding block so that it is smooth.

Next up is [laying the track bed down]({% post_url 2023-10-05-scenic-ridge-8 %}) in the tunnels. Until then, happy modeling!
