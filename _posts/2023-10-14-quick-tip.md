After I had laid (and glued) my track down, I ran my train and encountered two problems. The first was a dead spot where the train just stopped, and the other was a very audible click going over a section I had glued down. I won't go into details on the track cleaning I did - I went onto Amazon to buy a [Walthers SceneMaster Bright Boy Cleaner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EXGNT0) and ran that all the way around the track that had been glued down, making the rail tops all shiny again. When in doubt, clean your track.

This post is about the second problem. Here is the problem piece of track (which was discovered by going over every joint using my phone as a magnifying glass):

Notice how the track joiner is only on one rail.  The other side is underneath the rail. The track is glued down, so pulling it all up and redoing the joint is not going to happen. To fix this, I pulled up just this joint.  On the side with the track joiner, I carefully pried the black sleeper adjacent to the track joiner off the rail using my utility knife.  Then, with my needle nose pliers, I pushed the track joiner further onto the rail so it was no longer interfering with the gap.

At this point, I can push the track back down so that the two rails line up.  Then, using the needle nose pliers, I gently pushed the track joiner back into place.

Now the trains run all the way around and I don't hear that annoying click.  Clicks indicate that the tracks are not properly joined, so listen for them!

Until next time, happy modeling!
