Benchwork - something to sit the layout on.  I must admit, I leveraged my friend, Matt, who is a DIY guy and has all the tools.  However, I did buy all the materials and some tools as well - mostly because Matt is a great friend who is also busy.  So, let's start with materials.  I got everything from my local Home Depot, so no links.  I suggest going into the store and selecting your materials, however.  The 1"x3" boards need to be fairly knot-free, and the plywood needs to be as flat as you can get it.

| Description | Qty | Unit Price | Total Price |
|+============|+===+|===========+|============+|
| 1 in. x 3 in. x 8 ft. Select Board | 5 | $2.64 | $13.20 |
| 4 ft. x 8 ft. x 1/2 in. Plywood | 1 | $48.45 | $48.45 |
| Griprite #6 x 1 5/8 in. screws | 1 lb. | $9.58 | $9.58 |
| Titebond II Wood Glue | 16 oz. | $9.98 | $9.98 |

Before leaving Home Depot, I went to the cutting center and asked the nice guy to cut the plywood to approximately 3'x6' - the size I need for the layout.  I actually got him to cut it a little bigger - 1 inch bigger all around (so 38"x74").  This left me with a 20"x8' piece and a smaller 2'x3' piece that I'm going to use elsewhere.  It's certainly not going to waste.

In terms of tools, I got the following:

* Stanley [14.5 in. Deluxe Clamping Miter Box with 14 in. Saw](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Stanley-14-5-in-Deluxe-Clamping-Miter-Box-with-14-in-Saw-20-600D/100034395)
* DeWalt cordless drill / driver with a drill / driver set that included a drill bit I needed (I already had this).
* A set of [PowerTex 12 in. Bar Clamps](https://www.homedepot.com/p/POWERTEC-12-in-600-lbs-Bar-Clamp-Set-F-Clamp-w-3-in-Throat-Depth-4-Pack-71626/323252336) (which I borrowed from Matt).
* 2 [saw horses](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Signature-Development-24-in-W-x-29-in-H-Wooden-Sawhorse-378739/100029549) to stand the finished product on.

Matt also offered a miter saw (like [this one](https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-14-Amp-Corded-10-in-Compound-Miter-Saw-with-LED-Cutline-Indicator-TS1346/306939211)), but I had already cut most of the lumber to size at that point.

Manufacturing was simple:

* Lay the plywood on the saw horses.
* Measure the long side of the plywood.
* Cut the 1"x3" board to the measure.
* Apply a bead of wood glue to the thin edge of the board.
* Using the bar clamps, clamp the cut board onto the underside of one edge of the plywood.  Use all the clamps.
* Make sure the board is straight!
* Drill pilot holes for the screws along the length of the plywood into the 1"x3" board.
* Drive screws into each board from above the plywood.
* Wipe off any excess glue with a slightly wet cloth that you don't want to use again.

Repeat for the other sides. Matt was great (aka, he did most of the work here and I just helped), so we did the shorter sides next, and then the other long side. We then cut 3 more cross-beams out of the 1"x3" - these were placed wide side down (rather than the sides that were narrow side down), glued and screwed in from the top and sides.  Two of the boards were fastened about 12" from the ends to give the saw horses something to sit on, and the other one was in the middle so I have something to screw electronics onto.

Here is the underside of the completed unit:

And here is what the top looks like:

It didn't turn out too badly, and for about $80 in materials.

So, what did I learn?

1. The 1"x3" boards aren't that size.  Buy a bigger thickness than you think you need.
2. 2 people help.  A lot.  Seriously, go find that friend that does DIY stuff.
3. A 3'x6' sheet of plywood does not fit easily in cars or SUVs.  Measure before you go to Home Depot to make sure it fits. Fortunately, Home Depot rents trucks by the hours.

## Next steps

In keeping with the "just-in-time" ordering I am doing for this project, I ordered the following bits:

* [Gochange 3 in 1 foam cutter set](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H28SCC9).
* [Gorilla Dual-temp glue gun](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K791YRP).
* [Woodland Scenics Scenic Ridge](https://www.hobbytown.com/woodland-scenics-scenic-ridge-layout-kit-n-scale-woost1482/p291522).
* [Atlas Scenic Ridge Track Pack](https://www.trainz.com/products/atlas-2588-n-scale-scenic-ridge-track-pack).
* [Atlas 44589 Union Pacific U25B Locomotive (with DCC)](https://www.trainz.com/products/atlas-44589-n-union-pacific-u25b-ph-2a-locomotive-637-w-dcc-ln-box).

I'm going to figure out DCC and wiring eventually, but for now, I've got some waiting to do for stuff to arrive.  In the meantime, to Youtube I will go!

See you next time!
