Back at the layout (after a nice diversion into train running and rolling stock upgrades), it's time to cast some rocks.  I'm going to note the instructions here and where they are wrong.  First off, step 1:

> Make a solution of "wet water."  Mix two drops of liquid dish soap in 1 cup of water.  Coat the inside of the Rock Molds with solution and pour out excess.  Wet water helps disperse air bubbles in rock castings and acts as a mold release agent.

This is easy enough.  I happen to have some wet water in a spray bottle, so it was a case of spraying the wet water in the chosen mold and then using my fingers to swish it around before pouring out the excess.  There are, incidentally, two molds.  One has three medium sized rocks and the other has a large rock and some smaller ones.  I'll probably use both.

> Secure Rock Molds in a level position.

They are really lumpy.  What I ended up doing was using some offcut pieces of foam to secure the molds level.

It's isn't perfect, but what is?

> Shake Lightweight Hydrocal for 30 seconds to mix contents.  Set aside 1 1/2 cups to attach rocks and culverts in a later step.

Ok, I guess.  Shake the bag?

> Prepare Lightweight Hydrocal using a clean, disposable bowl and utensils only.  Pour 2 1/2 cups of Lightweight Hyrdrocal into 1 cup of water.  Let stand for 2 minutes, then stir for 1 minute.

The ratio I am using is 1 cup of hydrocal to 1/2 cup of water.  I'm using a bowl with a spout that I got from Target (set of three for $15, and I'll re-use these) and one of the mixing sticks in the kit.  Don't expect to re-use the bowl for food.  It isn't going to happen.  I can clean it immediately afterwards for next time.  However, note that it must be fast - this stuff sets up.  You only have five minutes (hence why there are no photos of the steps).  To mix, pour the water on top of the hydrocal, let it sit for a minute, then stir it until it looks like runny cake batter.  If your mixture is too wet, it will take longer to dry.  If it's too dry, then it won't pour properly.

Pour the mix into the prepared molds.

Tap with the mixing stick to get the bubbles out.  Then leave them alone.

The instructions suggest that the molds are ready in 30-40 minutes.  You'll also notice that the second mold is only half full.  That's because I ran out of mix.  I could have made some more, but I think I'll see how these come out before chasing an alternative.  They give you plenty of mix.

Next up, unshelling the rock molds and painting.  Until then, happy modeling!
