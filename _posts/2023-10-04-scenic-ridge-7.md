Todays project involves getting trains running again, this time on the proper riser set. To do that, I have to position, tack, and glue the upper level of risers down. As I mentioned in [my last article]({% post_url 2023-10-03-scenic-ridge-6 %}), I want to try something different for the upper level, based on my experience with the lower level.  Explicitly, the Scenic Ridge kit has a large bottle of [foam tack glue](https://woodlandscenics.woodlandscenics.com/show/item/ST1444).  I'm going to put a bead of foam tack glue on the riser, then lay the upper riser on top of it, then tack it, then do the glue gun.

The foam tack glue dries slowly, so you'll need to leave the foam nails in longer as a result.  Otherwise, the process is the same.  Here is what it looks like once the process is done.

There are (somewhat obviously) two sides to the risers - at least the flat ones.  I opted to maximize contact area between the two sets of risers (upper and lower) when deciding what side to put down.  There is a place where the two tracks ascend together.  I opted to do the inner track first, then wait a good hour for glues to dry before continuing with the outside track.  I feel that went pretty well.

Keep a damp cloth handy to wipe the tip of your glue gun.  I had to do this several times when using the foam tack glue in conjunction with the glue gun.

I really wanted the next step to be laying track and running trains again.  However, there is a piece of foam that you need to cut to size for the in-tunnel overpass, and that really needs the outer track to dry enough that you don't need foam nails to hold it down.  So I waited, had dinner, then waited some more.  Eventually, I got to heating up the foam cutter and, measuring carefully (and marking where I needed to cut first with the foam pen), I cut the quarter inch notches in the two top risers to hold the overpass.

Once that was done, I could measure a foam board to fit the notches

These measurements were actually taken on the layout, and they were bigger in both directions than they needed to be.  It's easy to make it smaller and impossible to make it bigger.  Once that was cut out, I then test fitted it to the layout.

Nothing here is freehand. I've got a metal square and I use the straight edge of that to make all the cuts straight. As you can see, I needed to make a cut to make it fit - that's not a big deal.  Once cut, it fit like a charm. The only thing left to do was to lay down some glue and pin it in place to dry.

You will notice that the overpass is slightly lower than the track bed.  I'll put a small amount of card underneath it for support.  It's inside the tunnel, so I don't have to be too worried about the looks.

Now I just have to wait for the glue to set (I gave it an hour), and then remove the foam nails.  I'm ready to run some trains already!  Before I brought the track back in, I went over the top of the risers to ensure there weren't any small bits of glue that might cause problems.  Running your fingers across the length of the riser tops will quickly let you know whether there is or not.  Most of the globs I found were easily removed.  The one that was stubborn yielded to the gentle touch of my box cutter.

As you can see, some more track arrived from [Trainz](https://trainz.com), so I can complete the layout I want.  I may have to cut a piece of track to make it fit properly, and I'll do that as late as possible as there will be several more test track laying.

When I took the track up last time, I put several pieces together, but I didn't label them.  When I came to lay them back down, I forgot what pieces went where.  This time, I'm using a piece of masking tape on each section so that I remember which bits connect to where.

And, yes, trains were run!

Next time, I'm going to be laying plaster cloth in the tunnel areas. And I will run more trains.  Until then, happy modeling!
