Finally, I have time for more scenery.  This time, it's the tunnel portals.  These came bubble wrapped in the Scenic Ridge kit:

What you can't see is that they are cast and probably made out of Hydrocal.  They feel very flimsy.  The instructions say to:

* Paint the portal the same way you painted the rocks.
* Install them, cutting the plaster cloth if necessary.
* Glue them in place.

My layout isn't all neat like a pro has done it, so I decided to test-fit a portal.  None of the portals will fit where I need them to go!

Before I paint, I cut away the plaster cloth to make the portal fit.

Then I paint it using a paintbruch, the "splotching" method (my own invention!), and then a wash of the black.

Finally, I installed the portal in the correct location, using pink spackle as the glue.  This allowed me to fill in the gaps around the portal and where I had cut the plaster cloth.

Now all I have to do is clean up the pink stuff, wait for the pink to turn white, indicating it is dry.  Then I'll re-wash the portal to cover up the white, and paint the ground again.  

Just three more to do!  Until next time, happy modeling!
