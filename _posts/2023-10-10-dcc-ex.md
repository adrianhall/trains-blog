My DCC-EX command station has been sitting on my desk as a PCB sans-body for a while.  This is great for testing, but not for running trains in a dusty and dirty environment.  So it needed a box.  I ordered some stuff from Amazon and got to work.  Here is the stuff from Amazon:

For the list:

* [Raculety Project Box](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089K1KBL6)
* [Female DC Threaded Barrel Jack Panel Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091PS6XQ4) (we need 3; 8 in the pack)
* [M3 Male Female Nylon Hex Spacer Standoffs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNB1K5P2) (we need 4 sets; this is a large kit)
* [CERRXIAN 30cm Micro USB Mount Extension Dash Flush Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0816BP7KT)

That last one is too big - really the wrong thing.  But I got it, so I'll make do.  I also need some tools:

I raided the garage.  The big thing here (and it is big) is the power drill.  I have a drill bit that is the size of the hole needed by the jack panel adapters (which I determined by visual inspection).  The micro-USB mount needs a bigger hole, so I'll have to improvise a little bit there.  Aside from that, I need a Philips head screw driver and some tweezers for handling the standoff nuts into the right place.

First step is the standoffs.  If you take your motor shield off the Arduino main board, you'll notice four holes - one in each corner.  These are for mounting the board to a more permanent installation point - in this case, the box.  I attached an M3x15+6 standoff to three of them, pushing the screw part through the hole from the bottom.  I then used the small nuts to attach the standoff to the board.  The fourth one used an M3x15 standoff (without the screw part) and a M3*6 screw instead.  It was easier to fit because of the proximity of all the headers to the hole.  I pushed the screw all the way through the hole, then screwed the standoff to it from underneath.

Once that was done, I refitted the motor shield, and test-fitted the unit into the box.  It fits quite nicely!

This also allowed me to see about the positioning of the holes.  I had already decided I wanted the power on one side and the track outputs on the other.  I marked some holes so that they were nicely lined up, then drilled a pilot hole with a small drill bit.  Finally, I brought out the big drill and finished off the holes.  Tip: Hold the box with an iron grip. The torque that an electric drill provides is impressive.

The USB extension cable took a larger hole.  I just wiggled the drill around, enlargening the hole until the cannister of the socket fit.  Once that was done, it was a case of installing the panel adapters:

As you can see, the micro-USB cable is intrusive - too big, really.  If I had this to do over again, I would have done something different.  Fortunately (for me), the project boxes comes in twos.  If I find a suitable panel adapter for the micro-USB cable, I'll re-do it.  Once the panel adapters were installed, it was a case of wiring everything to the right spots, tightening down the screws, and giving it a test run.  Remember that the main track goes to the A outputs and the programming track goes to the B outputs.

Once the unit it verified as working, you can close it up by installing the top and screwing it together.

If I had a suitable micro-USB cable in there, the Arduino unit would sit flat on the bottom of the case, and I would use some super glue on the ends of the standoffs to install the Arduino permanently in the box.  As it is, it doesn't sit flat and it's going to be floating in the box instead.  This may cause some problems down the road, but it's ok for now.
